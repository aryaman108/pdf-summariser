This is a test document for the summarization app. Machine learning is a powerful technology that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms and statistical models to analyze patterns in data and make predictions or decisions. Artificial intelligence encompasses machine learning as one of its key components, along with other technologies like natural language processing and computer vision. The field has grown rapidly in recent years with applications in healthcare, finance, transportation, and many other domains.
