# Best Text Summarizer Project Plan

## Analysis of Research Papers

Based on the provided papers, key themes include:

- **Extractive Summarization**: Using BERT, RoBERTa for sentence scoring and selection (e.g., papers 2, 4, 5, 7, 14).
- **Abstractive Summarization**: T5, GPT models for generating summaries (e.g., papers 3, 6, 10, 11).
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining extractive and abstractive for better results (e.g., papers 2, 8, 12).
- **Advanced Techniques**: Semi-supervised learning, consistency loss, reinforcement learning (e.g., papers 3, 11).
- **Model Comparisons**: RoBERTa and T5 are frequently mentioned as high-performing (e.g., papers 1, 3, 6).

## Best Game Plan

### Architecture Design

- **Hybrid Pipeline**:
  - Use RoBERTa for extractive summarization to select key sentences.
  - Feed selected sentences into T5 for abstractive refinement.
- **Feasibility**: Both models are feasible; RoBERTa excels in understanding context, T5 in generation.

### Key Components

- **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, cleaning, using datasets like CNN/DailyMail.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Semi-supervised with consistency loss for robustness.
- **Evaluation**: ROUGE, BERTScore, human evaluation.

### Implementation Steps

1. Set up environment (Python, Transformers library).
2. Implement RoBERTa extractive module.
3. Implement T5 abstractive module.
4. Integrate hybrid pipeline.
5. Train and evaluate on benchmarks.

### Technology Stack

- Python, Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch.
- Datasets: Hugging Face datasets library.

## Roadmap

- Phase 1: Research and design.
- Phase 2: Implementation.
- Phase 3: Testing and optimization.
