    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms
    that can learn from and make predictions on data. The field has grown significantly in recent
    years due to advances in computational power and the availability of large datasets.

    There are several types of machine learning approaches:
    1. Supervised learning: Uses labeled training data
    2. Unsupervised learning: Finds patterns in unlabeled data
    3. Reinforcement learning: Learns through interaction with environment

    Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers
    to model complex patterns in data. This approach has been particularly successful in
    areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

    The future of machine learning looks promising with ongoing research in areas such as
    explainable AI, federated learning, and quantum machine learning.
